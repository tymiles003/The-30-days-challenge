# The 30 days challenge

It's easy to wake up one morning and saying I wish I had a *six pack* or I wish 
a could write a fiction book. We all have these moments in our lives. It's like 
taking a new resolution to go to the gym every morning. This is particularly 
boring expecial when you have no one you can follow as a model or nothing to 
motivate you on the path to your goal.

**The 30 days challenge** is meant to motivate you through your path to your goal. 
It aims to track every progress you make every day so you have a clear view of 
how far you have come when ever you look back at your starting point.

It also aim to serve as a model and source of inspiration. You an follow up with 
other trying to achieve same goals as you. Or you could even follow the steps of 
someone that has already achieved same goal.
